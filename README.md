 ## API ##
 
 Github Repo:
 https://akabab.github.io/superhero-api/api/
 
 For the API we are going to consume the [akabab]( https://akabab.github.io/) api from Super heroes.
 
 It has a lot of data about all the superheroes that exist. 
 
 >It's like 600 records.!
 
 
 But in this exercise we are going to use only the endpoint that ALL superheroes bring, to use the data we need.
 
 Each super hero has many images (xs-xm-md-xl). Let's use xs for the thumbnail and xl for the fullscreen
